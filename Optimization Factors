Limiting Factors
----------------
Number of Classes
	A number of Classes may be created up to MAX_NUM_CLASSES
	MAX_NUM_CLASSES = MAX(MAX_NUM_CLASSES_1, MAX_NUM_CLASSES_2, MAX_NUM_CLASSES_3)
		1) MAX_NUM_CLASSES_1 = TOTAL_BUDGET / FACULTY_COST_PER_CLASS
			Assume that Professors are paid by FACULTY_COST_PER_CLASS * numClassesTaught
		2) MAX_NUM_CLASSES_2 = numOpenClassrooms
		3) MAX_NUM_CLASSES_3 = SUM(Professors.NumClassesCanTeach)
Number of units
	Each term, Students are given a unit cap

Items to Maximize
-----------------
Number of Courses available for each Student
	Assume that a certain percentage of Students that are able to take a given course will take that course
	This percentage will probably be determined by the average percentage of Students which has taken this given course in over the past 4 terms
Number of Students in each partially filled Class
Number of Students that can move to graduation

Items to Minimize
-----------------
Number of Classes
	If one or more Schedules can be created -- with reasonable class availability for each student -- which don't reach MAX_NUM_CLASSES, then the cheapest such Schedule is considered optimal
Number of Course conflicts
	A conflict occurs when a given Student can sign up for 2 or more Classes that meet at the same time
	Or should it be this?: A conflict occurs when a given Student can sign up for 2 or more Courses which have all of their sections meeting at the same time
