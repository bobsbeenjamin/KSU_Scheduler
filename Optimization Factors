Limiting Factors
----------------
Number of Classes
	A number of Classes may be created up to MAX_NUM_CLASSES
	MAX_NUM_CLASSES = MIN(MAX_NUM_CLASSES_1, MAX_NUM_CLASSES_2, MAX_NUM_CLASSES_3)
		1) MAX_NUM_CLASSES_1 = TOTAL_BUDGET / FACULTY_COST_PER_CLASS
			Assume that Professors are paid by FACULTY_COST_PER_CLASS * numClassesTaught
		2) MAX_NUM_CLASSES_2 = numOpenClassrooms
		3) MAX_NUM_CLASSES_3 = SUM(Professors.NumClassesCanTeach)
Number of units
	Each term, Students are given a unit cap

Items to Maximize
-----------------
Number of Courses available for each Student
	Assume that a certain percentage of Students that are able to take a given course will take that course
	This percentage will probably be determined by the average percentage of Students which have taken the given course in over the past 4 terms
Number of Students that can move to graduation
	A student can move to graduation if they are able to take all remaining required courses for their curriculum:
		Seniors must not exceed their unit cap in order to take these Courses
		All such Courses must be offered in such a way that some certain setup of sections does not have conflicting time slots
		When all seniors meet the above reqs, they must not overfill the ClassRooms that house the Classes involved

Items to Minimize
-----------------
Number of Classes
	If one or more Schedules can be created -- with reasonable class availability for each student -- which don't reach MAX_NUM_CLASSES, then the cheapest such Schedule is considered optimal
Number of Course conflicts
	A conflict occurs when a given Student can sign up for 2 or more Classes that meet at the same time
	Or should it be this?: A conflict occurs when a given Student can sign up for 2 or more Courses which have all of their sections meeting at the same time
Facility bottlenecks
	Bottlenecks occur when large numbers of students start or end classes at the same time in the same building
Number of open seats in all ClassRooms combined
